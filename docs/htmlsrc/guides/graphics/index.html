<h1>Graphics in Cinder</h1>
<p>Cinder exposes a number of different graphics API's, each with different purposes. This guide serves as a starting point for these various technologies.</p>

<h3>Core Technologies</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>OpenGL</strong> - Cinder's most commonly used graphics API, used for high-performance, GPU-accelerated graphics.</li>
	<li><strong>Raster Images</strong> - for CPU-based image processing and I/O. Most commonly used through <ci>ci::Surface</ci>, <ci>ci::Channel</ci> and the <ci dox = "ci::ip">ci::ip namespace</ci>.</li>
	<li><strong>Cairo</strong> - most suitable for vector graphics (such as SVG rendering). Primarily CPU-based.</li>
</ul>

<h3>GPU vs. Raster vs. Vector</h3>
<center><img src="threeup.png" /></center>
<p>Selecting among these technologies is obviously a function of what you want to do. Many tasks can be accomplished with any of these API's. However they each have different strengths with respect to performance and simplicity. We'll attempt a summary below of what in practice can be a complex topic.</p>

<p>OpenGL (and similar technologies) are based on rendering triangles. This is not ideal for curved shapes as it requires many triangles to create the illusion of curvature. Additionally, to make use of either geometric or image data, we must incur a time cost uploading this data from the CPU to the GPU. Furthermore, OpenGL does not make it simple to manipulate pixels directly, in general. However, GPUs often make these costs worth our while. Both 2D and 3D. Their ability to render triangles quickly is what makes just about all modern realtime graphics possible.</p>

<p>Raster (or pixel-based) graphics excel in manipulating pixels, either individually or through broader strokes through operations like blurs. It's straightforward to write C++ code that manipulates pixels. However these operations can be substantially slower than the GPU equivalents. Additionally, rendering either 2D or 3D shapes with these APIs can be prohibitively complex.</p>

<p>Vector graphics express primarily 2D shapes as combinations of lines and BÃ©zier curves. They're most commonly associated with print, but are useful in any context in which resolution-independence is important. Cinder provides a wrapper around <a href="http://cairographics.org/">Cairo</a> - an industry-standard graphics library specifically designed for vector graphics. Must be rasterized - users used to the performance of hardware-accelerated OpenGL are often surprised at how much more costly CPU-based rasterization often is. Additionally, Cinder provides classes relevant for manipulating vector shapes, namely <ci>ci::Shape2d</ci>, <ci>ci::Path2d</ci> and <ci>ci::Polyline</ci>.</p>

<h3>Combining Graphics</h3>
<p>These technologies can be combined in various ways as well. Briefly, both <ci>ci::Surface</ci> and <ci>ci::Channel</ci> can be used to create images for OpenGL (called textures). Cairo can also rasterize images to <ci>ci::Surface</ci>, which can optionally be used to create an OpenGL texture. Finally, a <ci>ci::Surface</ci> can be used various Cairo contexts such as the creation of a <ci>cairo::Pattern</ci>.</p>

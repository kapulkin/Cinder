		<h1>Documenting Cinder</h1>
		
		<p>As an open source project, the Cinder community welcomes anyone interested in helping to document the library and/or write guides to help other developers progress their understanding of the library as well as graphics programming techniques. There are many different ways to contribute to this documentation and this guide is meant to walk through those different avenues. You may want to take a look at the <a href='building_docs.html'>Building Docs guide</a> before reading this one.</p>

			<h2>Documentation Anatomy</h2>

			<h3>Documentation Generation</h3>
			<p>Cinder documentation generation is a 2 step approach; </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Exporting source code documentation</li>
				<li>Html generation and integration with guides</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h4>1. Exporting source code documentation</h3>
			
			<p>The first part uses Doxygen to generate a series of xml files, one for each namespace, class, struct, and interface in the library and a master tag file (cinder.tag) which encapsulates the relationships between all of those files. Once we have all of that source data, we move on to the next step, which involves integration with supplemental material.</p>

			<h4>2. HTML generation and integration with guides</h3>
			<p>The Cinder documentation framework includes a way to add documentation to a classes specific documentation page as well as a way to easily link in to specific areas of the documentation in your html files. The integration happens via a python script, generateDocs.py, that parses all of the information and exports an html directory, ready for consumption.</p>

			<h3>Docs File Structure</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>doxygen/</strong> - for doxygen related files
					<ul>
						<li><strong>cinder.tag</strong> <em>(generated by Doxywizard)</em> - contains library source file data and relationship</li>
						<li><strong>Doxyfile</strong> - Export settings for Doxygen/DoxyWizard</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>html/</strong> <em>(generated by generateDocs.py)</em> - contains final html and asset files</li>
				<li><strong>htmlsrc/</strong> - contains all html source files, including css, javascript, mustache templates, and images
					<ul>
						<li><strong>_assets/</strong> - contains all css, images, and javascript files used throught the docs</li>
						<li><strong>_docs/</strong> - contains all supplemental class documentation</li>
						<li><strong>_templates/</strong> - mustache/html templates used by the python script to generate docs with</li>
						<li><strong>guides/</strong> - source files for all guides</li>
						<li><strong>index.html</strong> - markup for the index page</li>
						<li><strong>reference/</strong> - source files for reference pages</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>libs/</strong> - python libraries used my generateDocs.py</li>
				<li><strong>stylesrc/</strong> - contains style source files, including stylus (which is the preprossesor of choice) source files and a gulp file.</li>
				<li><strong>xml/</strong> <em>(generated by DoxyWizard)</em> - all of the files containing data for each source file documentation page.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Documenting Source Code</h2>
			<p>All of the inline comments within the cinder source code is turned into documentation in the Doxygen export step. For instance, if you open up a header file, you will commonly see block comments above each method that look like this. (from Surface.h)</p>

<pre><code>
/** \brief Constructs asynchronously a Surface from an images located at \a path. The loaded Surface is returned in \a surface.
If you are creating a Surface from an image that is located outside of the WinRT Windows Store App folder, you must use this method.
**/
</code></pre>

			or single line comments like this
<pre><code>
//! Returns the width of the Surface in pixels
</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>The &lt;ci&gt; tag</h2>
			<p>For writing supplemental material for the docs, we've created a special markup tag known internally as the &lt;ci&gt; tag. This tag is used to specify any content within the supplmental documentation html that needs to be linked into the source reference.</p>

			<p>These are the use-cases for the <code>&lt;ci&gt;</code> tag:
			
			<h3>To generate a link into a source documentation page</h3>
			<p>When writing guides, you may frequently want to reference specific source code constructs, such as a class, namespace, function, or enum. Since the docs are dynamically generated and the links may have long names that may change as the cinder library changes, you shouldn't have to worry about the specific linkage. So the ci tag makes it easy to link to that specific source code entry.</p>

			<p>For example, if you were writing a guide for FBOs and you wanted to link to Cinder's Fbo class, you could simply write:</p>
<pre lang="language-markup"><code>
An &lt;ci&gt;Fbo&lt;/ci&gt; represents an OpenGL Framebuffer Object.
</code></pre>
			<p>When the files is processed through the docs generation script, it will find and link up that tag to link to the correct html file. It will generate this: </p>
<pre lang="language-markup"><code>
An &lt;a href=&quot;../../classcinder_1_1gl_1_1_fbo.html&quot;&gt;Fbo&lt;/a&gt; represents an OpenGL Framebuffer Object.
</code></pre>

			<h3>To add a description to a specific class, interface, or struct</h3>
			<p>To avoid poluting the Cinder library header files, you can write additional descriptions in a separate html file and have it injected into the actual class' description. We do this by placing all of your content into a ci tag, giving it an atrtibute of <code>prefix</code> and setting the <code>dox</code> attribute to the class that you are documenting.</p>

<pre lang="language-markup"><code>
&lt;ci prefix dox=&quot;cinder::Fbo&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;FBOs are used for doing off-screen rendering, ...&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;!-- continue writing content here --&gt;
&lt;/ci&gt;
</code></pre>

			<h3>To link a guide to a specific class reference page</h3>
			<p>Guides are made way better when you can find them. So we've made it easy for you to link your guides up to any classes make sense to link to. For instance, The guide to using images in Cinder discusses Textures, Surfaces, and Channels. To associate that guide to those specific class pages, all you need to do is add these ci tags with a <code>seelalso</code> attribute to the html page head:</p>

<pre lang="language-markup"><code>
&lt;ci seealso dox=&quot;ci::Surface&quot; label=&quot;Images in Cinder&quot;&gt;&lt;/ci&gt;
&lt;ci seealso dox=&quot;cinder::ChannelT&quot; label=&quot;Images in Cinder&quot;&gt;&lt;/ci&gt;
&lt;ci seealso dox=&quot;cinder::gl::Texture2d&quot; label=&quot;Images in Cinder&quot;&gt;&lt;/ci&gt;
</code></pre>
			
			<p>Once those specific class reference pages are generated, a link to the guide will appear in the class detail side bar under "Related Links".
			<img class="shadow center" src="images/related_links.png" />
			</p>

			<h2>Writing Guides</h2>
			<p>To write a guide for cinder, follow these steps:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>adding meta tags for searchability</li>
				<li>config and linking guides</li>
			</ul>

		Cinder's documentation is comprised of a few facets, source code and guides.
